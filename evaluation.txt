Based on the sentences provided, I would diagnose that the child is around 4-5 years old.

The child's sentences are mostly simple and lack subordinating conjunctions, which is consistent with a 5-year-old child. However, some of the sentences also show errors in tense marking (e.g., "גלידה" instead of "גלידה", "הוא קיבל" instead of "הוא קיבל"), which is a characteristic error for 5-year-olds.

However, the child's language is more advanced than what is typical for a 4-year-old, as they are using simple sentences with a subject-verb-object structure and attempting to use conjunctions (e.g., "הוא קיבל" + "גלידה").

Given that the child is 5 years old, it is not uncommon to see some of these errors still present in their language. Nevertheless, it would be beneficial for a professional assessment by a speech-language pathologist or a pediatrician to confirm the child's language development and provide guidance on how to support their continued growth.

**Professional opinion is required** to determine if the child's language development is within the expected range for their age and to identify any potential areas of concern that may require further attention.
